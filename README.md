Our project involves configuring the given robot both from a hardware and a software perspective to make it perform some tasks. The tasks our robot can perform are: hardware test, Bluetooth control mode, obstacle avoid, object follow.

•	Hardware test: the robot moves forward while also moving its servo motor and reading data from the ultrasonic sensor.

•	Bluetooth control mode: the robot can be controlled from a mobile device through its Bluetooth module. The mobile device uses the “Bluetooth RC Controller” app (available on Google Play Store). The robot can also emit sounds.

•	Obstacle avoid: the robot moves and tries to avoid each obstacle it detects. When an obstacle is detected, the robot tries to go left or right and if both paths are blocked, turns around.

•	Object follow: the robot follows an object. If the object cannot be detected anymore, the robot looks continuously for it (left and right) until it is found again and it can be followed.
